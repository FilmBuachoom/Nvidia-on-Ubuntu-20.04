Installing NVIDIA drivers is crucial for TensorFlow GPU support, enabling GPU acceleration, providing CUDA and cuDNN libraries, ensuring compatibility and stability, and utilizing extra GPU features.

## Literature Review (Compiled by ChatGPT)
* **NVIDIA driver** <br>
The NVIDIA driver is software developed by NVIDIA Corporation specifically for NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs). It acts as a communication bridge between the operating system and the GPU hardware, providing an interface for software applications to utilize the GPU's capabilities. The driver includes libraries, APIs, and low-level components that enable GPU acceleration and enable features such as parallel processing, high-performance computing, and graphics rendering.
* **CUDA** <br>
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA. It allows developers to harness the power of NVIDIA GPUs for general-purpose computing tasks beyond graphics processing. CUDA provides a programming interface and a set of libraries that enable developers to write GPU-accelerated code. It includes a parallel computing architecture, a C/C++ compiler, and a runtime system that facilitates the execution of code on the GPU. TensorFlow, as well as other deep learning frameworks, can use CUDA to accelerate computations on NVIDIA GPUs.
